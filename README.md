## Problem Three
Logical Reasoning Question:
######   In this logic question, you are standing in a room with three light switches.
######   The switches all correspond to three different light bulbs in an adjacent room that you cannot see into.
######   With all the light switches starting in the off position, how can you find out which switch connects to which light bulb?

We have three light bulbs A,B,C and three switches As,Bs,Cs.
1. If we have a circuit diagram, we can tell their mapping right of way.
2. If we can have any feedback from the light bulbs' room. The answer is easy. Since all light are off, as we
turn each switch on there will be a corresponding light being turn on. Once we have feedback, just record
the relationship mapping for switches to light bulbs. The feedback can be you walk in to the room, another
person's word or any experimental set up.
3. If we don't have any feedback at all. There is no way to know the actual mapping except logical guessing.
Just like black holes.
Scientists can only make some hypothesises based on math and physics rules outside the black hole. People
can't really tell if we got the correct theories about black holes or not. Because black holes catches light,
scientists cannot observe and obtain any feedback to correct their theory.
